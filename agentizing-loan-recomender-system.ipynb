      "Based on the provided M-Pesa statement, your repayment ability is currently **low**. Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Consistent Outflow Exceeding Inflow:** Your total withdrawals ($55,391.65) significantly exceeded your total income ($52,769.59). This indicates a net loss of funds over the statement period.\n",
      "*   **Declining Balance:** Your ending balance ($0.38) is drastically lower than your starting balance ($61.79), and the average balance is also low. This suggests a trend of depleting funds rather than accumulating them.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Savings:** The very low ending balance implies little to no available savings for loan repayments, especially for unexpected expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommended Loan Type and Amount:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Given your current financial situation, it is **not advisable to take out a new loan at this time**. The risk of defaulting is high due to the demonstrated inability to manage current outflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a loan is absolutely necessary, it should be:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **A small, short-term loan:** This would minimize the overall financial burden and reduce the repayment period.\n",
      "*   **For a critical, income-generating purpose:** The loan should ideally be used for an investment that has a clear and quantifiable path to increasing your income to cover the repayment and provide a surplus.\n",
      "*   **Amount:** The amount should be strictly limited to what you can demonstrate, with a high degree of certainty, that you can repay within a short period. This would likely be a very small fraction of your current monthly income, perhaps not exceeding 10-15% of your total income, assuming you can also cover your essential expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Repayment Insights:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Prioritize Existing Financial Health:** Before considering any new loan, focus on addressing the existing income-outflow imbalance. Implement a strict budget, track all expenses meticulously, and identify areas for significant cost reduction.\n",
      "*   **Increase Income Streams:** Actively seek opportunities to increase your income. This could involve side hustles, negotiating a raise, or seeking higher-paying employment.\n",
      "*   **Debt Management:** If you have existing debts, prioritize paying them down. High interest payments on existing debt can exacerbate your current outflow problem.\n",
      "*   **Emergency Fund:** Build an emergency fund. Even a small fund of 1-2 months of essential living expenses can prevent you from needing to rely on loans for unexpected events.\n",
      "*   **Financial Consultation:** Strongly consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can help you create a personalized debt management and budgeting plan, assess your true borrowing capacity, and explore responsible financial strategies.\n",
